# Unity Proving Grounds


This will be my dumping ground for my minor escapades in Unity, every project listed on the table below has a gif attached to their readme file for demonstration.

>All projects are Under: [Assets/Prototypes/](Assets/Prototypes) Each project is self-isolated, anything these projects share will be put under [Assets/](Assets/) with a folder prefix of "**Generic**"


Adventures so far:

| Index | Project       | Progress      |  Description  |
|:------|:-------------:|:-------------:| -------------:|
| 0 | [Generic Helper Scripts](Assets/GenericScripts/Utility) | Completed | My set of helper scripts that I pretty much use everywhere (STHelper and RGHelper) |
| 1 | [Simple Save/Load System](Assets/Prototypes/SaveLoadSystem) | Completed | Serialization/Deserialization of runtime objects and physical storage of these objects |
| 2 | [Graph Path Finding](Assets/Prototypes/SearchAlgorithms) | Completed but I might add more pathfinding algorithms | Graph-Node based pathfinding and efficent storage of graph paths in form of objects. |
| 3 | [Stats System](Assets/Prototypes/StatSystem) | Completed | Property management system that I used in one of my projects, refactored to fit into any project |
| 4 | [Graphing mathematical functions](Assets/Prototypes/MathGraph) | Done, might add more renderers | Graphing mathematical functions by use of different rendering types. |
| 4 | [Event Notifier](Assets/Prototypes/EventNotifier) | Completed | Light-Weight Observer Pattern implementation. Very easy to add anywhere. |
