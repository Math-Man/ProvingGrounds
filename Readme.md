# Unity Proving Grounds


This will be my dumping ground for my minor escapades in Unity

All projects are Under: [Assets/Prototypes/](Assets/Prototypes) Each project is self-isolated, anything these projects share will be put under [Assets/](Assets/) with a folder prefix of "**Generic**"

Each Unity adventure I'll take will be located under Assets/Prototypes/ and contain readme detailing that project

Adventures so far:

| Index | Project       | Progress      |  Description  |
|:------|:-------------:|:-------------:| -------------:|
| 0 | Generic Helper Scripts | Completed | My set of helper scripts that I pretty much use everywhere (STHelper and RGHelper) |
| 1 | Simple Save/Load System | Completed | Serialization/Deserialization of runtime objects and physical storage of these objects |
| 2 | Graph Path Finding | Completed but I might add more pathfinding algorithms | Graph-Node based pathfinding and efficent storage of graph paths in form of objects. |
| 3 | Graphing mathematical functions | Just Started | Graphing mathematical functions by use of different rendering types. |
