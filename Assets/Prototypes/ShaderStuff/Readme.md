# VFX / Shader Stuff

I've been learning VFX and thought that I made some proving grounds worthy stuff, not everything has to be about code.


| VFX Name | Description |
|:---------|------------:|
|Black Hole|Uses a heat distortion effect made in shader graph and VX Particles|
|Spark and AOE Effect|Uses very simple shaders and many particle systems for fancy effect|
